IMPORTANT NOTE: This plugin has nothing to do with the original 'WorldGuard' plugin for 'Bukkit' which is available [here](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/worldguard). This plugin was built from scratch by an entirely different team than the one behind WorldGuard for Bukkit and is not affiliated to them in any way.


# Features
- User friendly interface for users that prefer a menu rather than typing lenghty commands.   
- Easily define regions in your world.
- Set custom flags on defined regions that allow/restrict certain actions and events.
- Delete/Modify already defined regions.
- Give special permissions to your players to bypass certain flags. (Usefull for mods, admins, vips, etc.)

# Utility
- Defined regions can be used to protect specific areas of your world from griefing, pvp, damaging mobs, building, and some other events.  
For the full list of flags check the tutorial.
